# AI Hackathon Winner - Machine Learning, EDA & Chatbot Development with LLM Training

## Overview

This repository contains the code, problem sets, and results from the AI Hackathon in which I won first place. The hackathon consisted of two tasks:

- **Task 1: Machine Learning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Task 2: Chatbot Development with LLM Training**

## Task 1: Machine Learning & EDA

In the first task, I tackled a machine learning problem that required developing a model to achieve the highest accuracy. The task included:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the data.
- **Model Selection:** Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- **Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.


## Task 2: Chatbot Development with LLM Training

The second task involved building an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries effectively. The development process included:

- **LLM Training:** The chatbot was trained on provided PDFs using a large language model (LLM) to enhance its knowledge base and improve its response accuracy.
- **Intent Recognition:** Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify user intents.
- **Dialog Management:** Creating a flow to manage conversations seamlessly.
- **Deployment:** Implementing the chatbot to interact with users in a real-time environment.



## Getting Started

To explore the code and run the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-hackathon-winner.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ai-hackathon-winner
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks or scripts as needed.

## Results

- **Task 1:** Achieved the highest accuracy in the machine learning challenge.
- **Task 2:** Developed a chatbot with the best performance metrics, significantly enhanced by LLM training.
